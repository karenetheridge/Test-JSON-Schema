=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test2::V0l
  use Test::JSON::Schema;

  # something in your application that generates a data structure
  # { foo => 1, bar => 2 }
  my $data = MyApp->execute(...);

  is(
    $data,
    json_schema({
      properties => {
        foo => { type => 'string' },
        bar => { type => 'number' },
      },
    }),
    'data matches the expected schema',
  );

  # file contains: { "type": "number" }
  load_json_schema('t/data/common-app-data-format.json');

  is(
    $data,
    json_schema({
      properties => {
        foo => { type => 'string' },
        bar => { '$ref' => 'file://t/data/common-app-data-format.json' },
      },
    }),
    'data matches the expected schema, with some of it loaded from an external file',
  );

  is(
    'hello',
    json_schema('t/data/common-app-data-format.json'),
    'data matches the expected schema, with the entirety of it loaded from an external file',

prints:

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=for stopwords vapourware

NOTE: this distribution is currently vapourware and is not yet implemented!
If you have some opinions about the interface, please come talk to me!

Use a JSON Schema to describe your expected data structure, and embed that in a Test2 function call.

=head1 FUNCTIONS/METHODS

=head2 json_schema

Expresses expected data in the form of a JSON Schema.

=head2 load_json_schema

Loads a JSON Schema into the evaluator so it can be used in subsequent C<json_schema> calls.

If it is a hashref, it is treated as an inline JSON Schema; you must include an C<$id> keyword so it
can be later used via C<$ref> keywords. If it is a string, it is treated as a filename: the file is
loaded from disk; it must have a C<.json> or C<.yaml> extension so that its format can be
determined.  The filename itself is used as the identifier, if an C<$id> keyword is not used in the schema.
